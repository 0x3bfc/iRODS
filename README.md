# iRODS
Ansible Scripts for Installation and Deployment of IRODS

#iRODS use cases:

* iRODS enables data discovery using a metadata catalog that describes every file, every directory, and every storage resource in the data grid.
* iRODS automates data workflows, with a rule engine that permits any action to be initiated by any trigger on any server or client in the grid.
* iRODS enables secure collaboration, so users only need to log in to their home grid to access data hosted on a remote grid.
* iRODS implements data virtualization, allowing access to distributed storage assets under a unified namespace, and freeing organizations from getting locked in to single-vendor storage solutions.
